## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?
Functions are like Wakanda - you can perform tasks inside of the functions and have them stand on their own. Functions are like a machine making Vibranium weapons without the rest of the world knowing.

2. What is a parameter?
Paramaters are informations that are passed to a function to be run.

3. What is a return value?
Return value is the answer that the function processed

4. In the space below, declare a function named `hello` that will print to the console, `"Sam I am"`.
```
function hello() {
  console.log('Sam I am')
};
hello();
```
5. Declare a function name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.
```
function helloSomeone(name) {
  console.log(name + " I am")
};

helloSomeone('Chad');

```

6. How would you _call_ or _execute_ the function that you created above?
name('Sam');

helloSomeone('Chad');

7. What questions do you still have about functions in JavaScript?
This was very confusing - I had to do a lot of video tutorials and CodeAcademy in order to finish the assignment. For future classes, I would recommend linking the CodeAcademy lesson to the functions-and-variables.js?
