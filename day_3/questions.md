## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.
```
A conditional statement is a hypothesis (if) with possible conclusions (else) depending on what the user has input.
When starting on your computer at school, you have the option to log in, continue as guest, restart, or shut down.
```
2. Why might you want to use an `if` statement?
```
You would use an 'if' statement whenever you have multiple options that can happen from one question. This would allow the program to offer different outcomes depending on what the user input.
```
3. What is the JavaScript syntax for an `if` statement?
```
if (condition) {
  console.log("Text to execute if the value is true")
}
```
4. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement?
```
if (cupsOfFlour == 1 && hasSauce == true) {
```
5. What is the JavaScript syntax for an `if/else` statement?
```
} else if (var == #) {
  console.log("Text to execute if else if value is true")
  ```
6. Other than an `if` statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?
```
We would want an else statement, just in case all other statements aren't the path that is chosen, the user won't get an error screen.
```
